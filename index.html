                <p>
                    Students who walk to class everyday face difficulties with getting lost, knowing
what time they need to leave in order to arrive at their destination on time, and
ensuring that they are taking the most efficient route. When beginning college,
students are often left to just figure it out on their own without any real guidance
or an in-depth understanding of how the campus is laid out thus causing extra
and unnecessary tardiness, stress, and confusion.
